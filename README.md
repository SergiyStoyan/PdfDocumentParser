## PdfDocumentParser

PdfDocumentParser is a parsing engine intended to find and extract text/images from PDF documents that conform to a recognizable graphic layout - such as invoices and the like.

Within this scope PdfDocumentParser is capable of the following:
- search/extract text represented by PDF entities;
- search/extract text obtained by OCR;
- search/compare/extract page fragments as images;

PdfDocumentParser provides:
- Template Editor where parsing templates can be created or debugged in an easy manner;
