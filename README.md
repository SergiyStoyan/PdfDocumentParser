## PdfDocumentParser

PdfDocumentParser is a parsing engine intended to find and extract text/images from PDF documents that conform to predictable graphic layouts - such as forms, CV's, invoices and the like. Its parsing approach is based on finding certain text or image fragments in page and then extracting text/images located relatively to those fragments.

PdfDocumentParser does all the tricky job of building parsing templates, search, recognition and extraction, thus, leaving you only to code a custom logic.

PdfDocumentParser is a .NET DLL.
