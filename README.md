## PdfDocumentParser

PdfDocumentParser is a parsing engine intended to find and extract text/images from PDF documents that conform to predictable graphic layouts - such as  reports, bills, forms, tickets and the like. Its parsing approach is based on finding certain text or image fragments in page and then extracting text/images located relatively to those fragments.

PdfDocumentParser does all the tricky job of building parsing templates, search, recognition and extraction, thus, leaving you only to code a custom logic.

PdfDocumentParser is a .NET DLL.

For a sample of using PdfDocumentParser or a framework refer to SampleParser project in the repository.

## Usage
Do not download the latest code as is in a branch because it may be in development. Instead, go to releases and download the latest (pre-)release source code. Find SampleParser.sln and open it in Visual Studio. It will give a complete example of using PdfDocumentParser which you can modify according to your requirements.
